# SimultaneousScrolling
 Now this is something interseting. This experiment uses two customized ScrollViews. Here is what I have tried.
 
I am using four section

1. First it is static view no scrolling is allowed here.
2. Second it can be scrolled horizontal only.
3. Third it can be scrolled vertical only.
4. Fourth it can be scrolled both vertically and horizontally.

The interesting thing is that when second section is scrolled horizontally so simultaneously fourth section also scrolled in horizontal direction & vice versa and if third section is scrolled vertically so fourth section also scrolls in vertical direction and vice versa.
